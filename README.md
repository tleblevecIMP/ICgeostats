# ICgeostats
Exercise material for the geostatistical course at Imperial College given for master students. 
For using this code, you need first to install the package RGeostats at http://rgeostats.free.fr/

The course created by Olivier Dubrule reviews geostatistical technics for the oil industry. 
It also gives the fundamentals of statistics and probabilities by studying continuous and discrete random variables. 
Physical understanding of the variogram and indicator variogram is given more than the mathematical background. 
The geostatistical algorithms are also explained in details: kriging, SGS, SIS, PGS, Object-based, and MPS. 

At the end of the course the student should understand the importance of geostatistics, and which technic is best using depending 
on the type of reservoir. 

This code gives pratical insight of some methods such as SGS and PGS and their link with the variogram.
Small problems for the oil industry are also given using Monte Carlo simulation.
